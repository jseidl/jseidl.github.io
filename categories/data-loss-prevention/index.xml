      <title>Endpoint DLP: Is hardware access control enough?</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve stumbled on this article about using a custom-built hardware to bypass hardware enforcement on most DLP solutions available on market.
The solution uses an Atmel&amp;#8217;s AVR microcontroller (the same on the Arduino&amp;#8216;s I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around lately) and the V-USB library to create a virtual USB device and is crafted to announce itself as HID (Human-interface device). What common hardware fits this description: the keyboard. As you are not likely to forbid keyboard access to your users (or else they wouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to type and thus work), this will gracefully pass through many enforcements.</description>
