      <description>Sometimes I took some random Android app I&amp;#8217;ve recently installed on my phone and start performing some tests on it. It&amp;#8217;s not uncommon to see unauthenticated API requests, plaintext HTTP communication and some obfuscation logic or hardcoded credentials rammed down at client code.

As I&amp;#8217;ve been able to setup tcpdump-arm on my android phone, I began fooling around with it. I was trying to cross-compile Dug Song&amp;#8217;s dsniff into armle architechture but it was only giving me headaches within the libnet/libnids dependencies and stuff.
So I wrote a quick one-liner to dump potential credentials (username/password) flowing in plaintext over the line:</description>
