      <description>Recently I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that GoldenEye got his first signature from a big vendor.
That&amp;#8217;s funny since the main GoldenEye objective is to be signature-proof due its randomness. I&amp;#8217;ve done a quick search on the internet and found the signature update link for their products, downloaded, located that one mentioned above.
It was a very crude signature, as expected:
&amp;lt;Pattern&amp;gt;\[Keep-Alive: 1(1\d|20)\]&amp;lt;/Pattern&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Pattern&amp;gt;\[Cache-Control: (must-revalidate, )?no-cache\].*&amp;lt;/Pattern&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Pattern&amp;gt;\[http://(www\.(google|usatoday)|engadget\.search\.aol)\.com/(search)?(/results)?\?q\].*&amp;lt;/Pattern&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Pattern&amp;gt;.*\[(Mozilla/\d\.\d|Opera 9.80) \((Windows|X11|compatible); U?; (Linux|Windows NT \d\.</description>

      <description>After the hackers 2 hackers conference talk last year, some people contacted me about known Python performance issues regarding the use of threads related to the GIL.
Indeed the threading wasn&amp;#8217;t performing well due the nature of GIL so I&amp;#8217;ve rewritten the code to support Python&amp;#8217;s multiprocessing module. It&amp;#8217;s a tad faster but I haven&amp;#8217;t tested it exhaustively so if you feel the inner-beta-tester in you, let me know!
The download is available as always at the github project page at https://github.</description>

      <description>Hi Folks,
This last weekend was my talk on Hackers 2 Hackers Conference 9th Edition @ SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The talk was in portuguese and the slides are available here (download pdf) and here (slideshare).
The subject of the talk was about layer 7 denial of service techniques and tools, using haproxy and socat to create a distributed denial of service from a single node, some XSS payload for DDoS and demonstration of the GoldenEye Mobile tool released today.</description>
