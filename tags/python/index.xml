      <description>Today I&amp;#8217;m releasing a project I&amp;#8217;ve been working on for the past week which I called VirtuaPlant (yeah I now, I suck at giving names).
From the project page:
 VirtuaPlant is a Industrial Control Systems simulator which adds a “similar to real-world control logic” to the basic “read/write tags” feature of most PLC simulators. Paired with a game library and 2d physics engine, VirtuaPlant is able to present a GUI simulating the “world view” behind the control system allowing the user to have a vision of the would-be actions behind the control systems.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that GoldenEye got his first signature from a big vendor.
That&amp;#8217;s funny since the main GoldenEye objective is to be signature-proof due its randomness. I&amp;#8217;ve done a quick search on the internet and found the signature update link for their products, downloaded, located that one mentioned above.
It was a very crude signature, as expected:
&amp;lt;Pattern&amp;gt;\[Keep-Alive: 1(1\d|20)\]&amp;lt;/Pattern&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Pattern&amp;gt;\[Cache-Control: (must-revalidate, )?no-cache\].*&amp;lt;/Pattern&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Pattern&amp;gt;\[http://(www\.(google|usatoday)|engadget\.search\.aol)\.com/(search)?(/results)?\?q\].*&amp;lt;/Pattern&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Pattern&amp;gt;.*\[(Mozilla/\d\.\d|Opera 9.80) \((Windows|X11|compatible); U?; (Linux|Windows NT \d\.</description>
