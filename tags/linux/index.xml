      <description>Hi Folks, I&amp;#8217;m a heavy Guake Terminal user and I just installed the latest Backtrack 5 revision (R3) and installed Guake on it. I was surprised when I tried to start by getting the message:
 &amp;#8220;Guake can not init!\n\nGconf Error.\nHave you installed guake.schemas properly?&amp;#8221;
 Long story short, it seems that the package bundled with this version of Backtrack (and maybe others) have a bug into the debian package file/script that installs the guake.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m always concerned about leaving terminal sessions open. I&amp;#8217;ve used for many and many years the $TMOUT environment variable to close my sessions if idle for N seconds.
Just by exporting the TMOUT variable to the number of desired timeout seconds will close your shell (Bash, Ksh, Zsh and some others).
The following example will timeout in 300 seconds (5 minutes)
export TMOUT=300 I am currently reading the book Secure Coding: Principles &amp;amp; Practices and the authors cited this timeout technique as pretty ineffective since it annoys more than it helps.</description>
