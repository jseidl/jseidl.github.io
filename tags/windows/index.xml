      <description>Symantec released an in-depth analysis of W32.Stuxnet, reviewed through IDA-PRO. The analysis shows off the staged infection process, the unusual injection of legitimate services instead of issuing LoadLibrary calls, core encryption and exported functions.
Tofino Security (specialized on SCADA security) has released an excellent white paper on the case (requires [free] registration). If you are a Malware Researcher / Reverse Engineer or just curious, I totally recommend it.
There&amp;#8217;s code, great explanation, images, graphs and such explaining it all the process from infection, rooting and the propper malware code.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m quite not a fan of GUI utilities but I&amp;#8217;m a great fan of command-line and batch processing.
I&amp;#8217;ve recently changed profiles under a Windows box and had to move some files over them. At first wondered about logging in as the old user, copy all the files to a temp folder, log back as my new user and copy them to my new folder. But hell, too much time spent.</description>
