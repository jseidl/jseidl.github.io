      <description>After the hackers 2 hackers conference talk last year, some people contacted me about known Python performance issues regarding the use of threads related to the GIL.
Indeed the threading wasn&amp;#8217;t performing well due the nature of GIL so I&amp;#8217;ve rewritten the code to support Python&amp;#8217;s multiprocessing module. It&amp;#8217;s a tad faster but I haven&amp;#8217;t tested it exhaustively so if you feel the inner-beta-tester in you, let me know!
The download is available as always at the github project page at https://github.</description>

      <description>Ettercap is a great tool for MITM poisoning and sniffing. Everyone on Infosec should have played with it (or Cain) at least once.
Man-In-The-Middle MITM attacks are pretty easy to perform on a local network but the tools tend to crash a LOT. Cain (Windows) is a little more stable than Ettercap but I prefer it over Cain because it doesn&amp;#8217;t spoof SSL that I consider too loud depending on the attack.</description>
