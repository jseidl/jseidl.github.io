      <description>These past weeks I&amp;#8217;ve been following the US drone hijacking by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.
Recently the details of the hacking were posted.
The IRG says the communication signals were jammed forcing the UAV to go into autopilot (RTL &amp;#8211; Return To Land, to be more precise). Then the GPS signals were spoofed to make the drone think that Iran Base was his Base.
US experts are still questioning these claims.</description>
