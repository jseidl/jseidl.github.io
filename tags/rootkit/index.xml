      <description>At my previous company I used to prank the colleagues who left their stations unlocked. I call this my &amp;#8220;internal awareness program&amp;#8221;.
It was all fun and games at the beginning. I would leave post-its on their monitors with a friendly message &amp;#8220;You could&amp;#8217;ve been hacked&amp;#8221; but it wasn&amp;#8217;t giving the expected results. Some colleagues found it funny and started &amp;#8220;collecting&amp;#8221; my post-its. There was a guy in particular with 5 of them.</description>

Since SCADA systems are updated mainly by CDs or pen drives, the attack vector fits as a glove. The malware targets Siemens&amp;#8217; Simatic WinCC software and intends to steal information like projects schematics and upload them to an external website.
From CNet:
 Once the malware locates the data it is looking for it encodes it and attempts to upload it to a remote server.</description>
