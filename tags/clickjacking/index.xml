      <description>In the past few days I&amp;#8217;ve started following the work of Samy Kankar, which has some great work. Among all of them, I&amp;#8217;ve almost-randomly picked one to play, Quickjack.
From Samy&amp;#8217;s project page:
 Quickjack is a tool developed to easily create pages with the capability to clickjack users no matter where they click on the page. The tool has an extremely intuitive interface and is literally a point-and-click tool.</description>
