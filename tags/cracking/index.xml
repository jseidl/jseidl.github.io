      <description>WPA was hit hard these days by a rumor of a new threat called &amp;#8216;Hole 196&amp;#8217;.
The hole would allow GTK (Group Temporal Key) spoofing forcing users to send the rogue AP their private key information leading to a awesome no-footprinted (medium is over air!) man-in-the-middle attacks.
To understand transient keys over WPA, Md Sohail Ahmad from AirTight said:
 WPA2 uses two types of keys: 1) Pairwise Transient Key (PTK), which is unique to each client, for protecting unicast traffic; and 2) Group Temporal Key (GTK) to protect broadcast data sent to multiple clients in a network.</description>

      <title>MDK3 goes bruteforcing Wireless SSIDs</title>

      <description>One good practice is to disable your SSID broadcast so you don&amp;#8217;t show up on the victims list. Although this doesn&amp;#8217;t make you completely invisible, it does aid reducing ease of location. (Networks can still be located by BSSIDs).
MDK3 was written by ASPj to bruteforce network SSIDs (even with wordlists).
Tape has done some testings around and described it all on his blog post. It has some videos too of the attack in progress on a 3-character-lenght SSID.</description>
