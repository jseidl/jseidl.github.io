      <description>Hi Folks,
This last weekend was my talk on Hackers 2 Hackers Conference 9th Edition @ São Paulo, Brazil. The talk was in portuguese and the slides are available here (download pdf) and here (slideshare).
The subject of the talk was about layer 7 denial of service techniques and tools, using haproxy and socat to create a distributed denial of service from a single node, some XSS payload for DDoS and demonstration of the GoldenEye Mobile tool released today.</description>

      <description>Hi folks! I&amp;#8217;m glad to inform that my paper &amp;#8220;Advanced DDoS techniques: Layer 7, load-balancing and mobile tools&amp;#8221; was accepted by the 9th Hackers 2 Hackers Conference (H2HC).
The event will take place on October 20-21 and it seems to be another success just like previous editions.
Don&amp;#8217;t forget to check the event&amp;#8217;s website for full line-up. If you can, enroll and enjoy!</description>
