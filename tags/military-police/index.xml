      <description>Today a friend shared me this link which pointed to São Paulo State&amp;#8217;s Military Police website and showed a deface-like page with a hacktivist text and a youtube video.
The first thing that came to my eyes was the URL:
http://www.polmil.sp.gov.br/abrirframes.asp?PAGINA=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nova89fm.com.br%2Fwebsite%2F &amp;#8216;abrirframes.asp&amp;#8217; is &amp;#8216;openframes.asp&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;PAGINA=&amp;#8217; is &amp;#8216;PAGE=&amp;#8217; in Brazilian Portuguese. Say no more.
That&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;ve said &amp;#8220;almost hacked&amp;#8221;. The site that was actually hacked was www.nova89fm.com.br (a Brazilian FM Radio) and not São Paulo State&amp;#8217;s Military Police&amp;#8217;s.</description>
