      <description>Ettercap is a great tool for MITM poisoning and sniffing. Everyone on Infosec should have played with it (or Cain) at least once.
Man-In-The-Middle MITM attacks are pretty easy to perform on a local network but the tools tend to crash a LOT. Cain (Windows) is a little more stable than Ettercap but I prefer it over Cain because it doesn&amp;#8217;t spoof SSL that I consider too loud depending on the attack.</description>

      <description>These presentations from May 8th, 2010 performed on the Brown Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky. on exploiting with the Metasploit framework has an tremendous value. Its from this month, still fresh! Its 7 hours of presentations, it takes a while to finish (I took almost a week! phew!) but its totally worth it!
It starts with Adrian &amp;#8220;Irongeek&amp;#8221; Crenshaw introducing Metasploit exploiting a Windows box via msfweb and msfconsole. Pretty neat.</description>
